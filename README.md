## Overview
The AutoHand is a simple project that aims to control an object (such as a hand) through certain hand gestures.

## How It Works
The human body is able to perform hand or arm movement through muscle contraction. However, in order for muscle contractions to occur, the brain must send electrical currents to the muscles. These electrical currents, also known as electromyography (EMG) signals, are collected through the use of non-invasive surface electrodes and the [Myoware Muscle Sensor](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13723), which are then passed into the circuit for signal processing. The raw EMG signals (that were just collected) are then integrated and rectified to become what is known as clean EMG signals as shown in the picture below:

It is important to note that there would be an extremely more complicated processes that occur during the signal processing phase for real prosthetics. However, since the clean EMG signal can be viewed as just an analog signal, it is fed straight into the Analog-to-Digital Converting (ADC) module to drive a Servo Motor. After the clean EMG signal has been converted to some digital value, the obtained digital value is then compared to a threshold value to see if the Servo Motor should move or not. If the digital value has exceeded the threshold value, the PWM signal that is sent to the Servo Motor changes in such a way that will make The AutoHand close. If the digital value is lower than the threshold value, the PWM signal that is sent to the Servo Motor changes in such a way that will make The AutoHand open. The PWM signal is generated by using a Timer1 module that hits the Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) every 1 ms to check if the PWM signal must change.
To summarize, when the user performs a strong muscle contraction by closing their hand, the digital value will be higher than the threshold value and thus The AutoHand will also close its hand. When the user opens their hand by relaxing their muscles, the digital value will be lower than the threshold value and thus The AutoHand will also open its hand.
